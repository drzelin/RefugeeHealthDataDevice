# Technical Design Document

# Status Reports

<p>
        We didn't do any real work over the break, but we are energized, excited and
        prepared for the semester ahead. In addition to our design document, we have a
        basic front-end set up, complete with tabular views. We have set up our app so
        that it deploys to both iOS and Android devices from a single code base. Last
        week, we regrouped and divided up tasks for the rest of the semester. For example,
        we decided to switch from a Django back-end to a Node JS backend.

<p>
        Next week, we are meeting with both our sponsor (Dean Panetta) and our client, Dr.
        Mollica. We are also planning to complete setting up our Node JS server, database,
        and finishing our front-end wireframes.
