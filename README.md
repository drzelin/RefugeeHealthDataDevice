# RefugeeHealthDataDevice

This project is a portable health and personal data-hiding device for women in 
refugee camps.

We will create a device that the patient will be able to carry when they travel
to various healthcare locations as it will store health information about all 
of the family members, and will help docotors assess a patients health history. 
The devices will be secure as well as easily accesible and maintainable. 

We are working under the supervision of Dr. Karen Panetta, Associate Dean for 
Graduate Education at Tufts University. We will also be working with the 
Harvard Medical School, Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma in conjunction with 
Massachussetts General Hospital. 

The aim of this project is to help women in  refugee camps that have 
experienced horrific trauma in their lives. With this personal data hiding 
device, we will be able to help the patients communicate with their doctors and
recieve the necessary treatment, while ensuring that their experiences are 
restricted for only the doctors to see.

Questions for Panetta - 
1. Previous project is an iPhone app - why? Would it be better to do a web 
   app/mobile web app?
2. Can we talk to Mollica to introduce ourselves?
3. Besides the databse iphone app/questions to go on the app, we don't believe
   the django code is that helpful
