# RefugeeHealthDataDevice

This project is a portable health and personal data-hiding device for women in regugee camps.

We will create a device that the patient will be able to carry when they travel to various healthcare locations as it
will store health information about all of the family members, and will help docotors assess a patients health history. The devices
will be secure as well as easily accesible and maintainable. 

We are working under the supervision of Dr. Karen Panetta, Associate Dean for Graduate Education at Tufts University. We will also be 
working with the Harvard Medical School, Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma in conjunction with Massachussetts General Hospital. 

The aim of this project is to help women in  refugee camps that have experienced horrific trauma in their lives. With this personal
data hiding device, we will be able to help the patients communicate with their doctors and recieve the necessary treatment, while 
ensuring that their experiences are resticted for only the doctors to see.
